        text : "I direct sowed these seeds in a raised garden bed and also started a few in 4 in containers just in case my direct sown seeds didn’t come up. Well everything sprouted successfully so I gave my starts to family. My three plants grew steadily and have been giving me a cucumber harvest every few days. My family’s plants are performing well and producing even in a spot without a full 6-8 hrs of sunlight. I had a problem with powdery mildew on my squash plants and inevitably started seeing a few spots on my cucumber plants, however they are so hardy, they kept going without a hitch and almost seemed to win the battle without my intervention. I think this is my favorite plant in the garden this year! I",

        text : "First planting was in a pot. Some cucumbers and was OK only. Second time now I planted in the ground. Many many flowers so far. I have low hanging ropes to enable them to grow upwards. Weather has cooled just a bit here on Maui in my very small senior citizen apartment dooryard garden, so, maybe a good crop.",

        text : "I have planted these in the past but had much better luck this year. 3 plants produced as much as I could eat (I am the only one in our house who eats cucumbers regularly). The cukes were crisp and sweet. The vines were definitely longer than I expected but were still much smaller than other varieties. They started dying in late August but overall I was impressed.",
